HOW TO BUILD WEBSITES ON YOUR OWN COMPUTER
Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts
In this project, you’ll build a simple website for a fictional arts and crafts store using the tools on your own computer. This project will provide you with less guidance than previous projects. You should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

* At a high-level, this project will require the following:

    * A folder structure that makes sense for the project
    * An HTML file
    * A CSS file
* To successfully complete the project, you’ll require the following images:

* The rest of the page’s styling (font sizes, colors, etc.) is outlined in the following design spec, which is a standard document you’d expect to receive as a freelance web developer:

* Use the website found in the Codecademy assginment and the resources above to guide you through the project.

    * Expand the project from the _project explorer (may just be called `explorer`)
    * Modify the `index.html` and `style.css` to complete the assignment.
    

### Part 3 - _Pushing_ new changes to repository

* From a _terminal_ navigate to the root directory of the _cloned_ project.

    * `git add .`
        * Add all files in current directory to the staging area       
    * `git commit -m 'I have made an edit to a file!'`

    * `git push -u origin main`
        * Push changes from local repository to remote repository
